DONE create note.component
DONE create "add" button at the top right part of the screen,
  * clicking on it will create a new sticky note
DONE Each sticky note will have an “X” button that deletes it
DONE When you click inside a sticky note you can edit it
DONE Every change (adding a sticky note, deleting a sticky note, 
  setting a sticky note text) will be saved to the local storage. 
  So if you refresh the page, it will look the same
- Bonus: add the abilitiy to drag&drop the sticky notes and change their position on the page
